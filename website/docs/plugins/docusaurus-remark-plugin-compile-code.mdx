# Remark plugin compile code

## Motivation

Execute tools, typically compiler, during build time
and inline the resulting output in the documentation.

## Configuration

## Usage

### npm tools

For tools distributed through `npm`, you
can provide the `.bin` name and `npm package`.

```js
{
    "lang": "ts",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "nodeBin": "tsc",
    "npmPackage": "typescript"
}
```

All code snippets for the given languages in the options will be extract by default.

```ts
// this code snippet snippet compiles just fine
let x = "hello";
```

This snippet has compilation issues

```ts
// this code snippet will be extract to file
console.llog("typo!");
```

### Inlined tools


```js
{
    lang: "echo",
    version: "0.0.0",
    compile: (source, langOptions) => ({
        code: 0,
        stdout: source
    })
}
```

```echo
This text is echoed in the output.
```
