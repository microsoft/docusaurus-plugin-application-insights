# GitHub Actions

Now that you've got the website building locally, it's time to setup a build script in GitHub Actions
to prepare for automatic deployment on every successful commit/build.

Add a root level `package.json` file that declares the `website` folder as a `yarn` workspace (and the `packages` folder).

```json title="package.json"
{
    "private": true,
    "workspaces": ["packages/*", "website"],
    "scripts": {
        "build": "cd website && yarn build"
    }
}
```

Add `.github/workflows/build.yml` to your project

```yml title=".github/workflows/build.yml"
name: Build and Deploy
on:
    workflow_dispatch:
    push:
    pull_request:
jobs:
    build:
        name: Build and Deployment
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
            GITHUB_REPOSITORY: ${{ github.repository }}
            GITHUB_REF: ${{ github.ref }}
            GITHUB_SHA: ${{ github.sha }}
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3

            - name: Cache ris4fun compile code
                id: docusaurus-rise4fun-compile-code
                uses: actions/cache@v3
                with:
                path: website/.docusaurus/docusaurus-remark-plugin-compile-code/
                key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}

            - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
              with:
                  node-version: 18.x
                  cache: yarn
                  cache-dependency-path: yarn.lock

            - name: yarn install
              run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

            - name: Build all
              run: yarn build

            - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
              uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
              if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
              with:
                  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                  publish_dir: website/build
                  force_orphan: true
```

Once a build passed, don't forget to enable GitHub Pages in your GitHub repository settings.
